# Angular Superhero Phonebook

This was originally an AngularJS project for my Web Development Immersive. I thought the concept was pretty cool so I decided to upgrade it to Angular with more features.

For original HW see [https://github.com/jessamarie/angular-superheroes/tree/angular-latest-upgrade](angular-latest-branch)

## Prompt

What's the single worse feeling in the world? Answer: When disaster strikes, and you need to call a superhero, but you've forgot their phone number.

That's why you're going to build a Superhero Phone Book!

Your application will display a list of superheroes and their phone numbers in the browser. The user should be able to search that list and the list should be color-coded based on the hero's comics affiliation (e.g., DC, Marvel). You'll also want to add a button next to each superhero that, when clicked, causes the hero's image to be displayed on the page.
